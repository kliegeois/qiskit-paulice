class CheckPickerStation:
    """Python-side driver of the Rust ``CheckPicker`` for one check-picking run.

    Exactly one of ``stabilizers`` and ``measured_qubits`` should be given; they define what
    a valid check is and what the metric protects.

    Args:
        circuit: Payload circuit, without measurements.
        n_checks_to_add: Number of ancilla qubits to reserve after the payload qubits.
        metric: Cost metric to minimize.
        noise_models: Rust noise models used by the metric.
        stabilizers: **Validity** (and, by default, cost). Paulis stabilizing the circuit's
            input state, as ``"all"`` (Z on every qubit, the stabilizer group of the all-zeros
            input), a list of :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Pauli` (phase ignored), or a list
            of internal labels, in which character ``i`` acts on qubit ``i``, the reverse of
            a Qiskit label. A check is valid iff its back-propagated product lies in the
            group they generate; its syndrome is the ancilla bit alone. Unless
            ``logical_stabilizers`` is given, the metric also counts an error as logical iff
            it anticommutes with the forward image of one of them.
        measured_qubits: **Validity and cost**, for measurement-anchored checks. Qubits
            measured in the Z basis at the end of the circuit, or ``"all"``. A check is valid
            iff its product, times Z on some measured qubits, propagates to the identity;
            those qubits join the syndrome. The metric counts an error as logical iff it flips
            a measured bit.
        logical_stabilizers: **Cost only**; never affects which checks are valid. Input
            stabilizers whose forward images the metric protects, in place of ``stabilizers``.
            Same formats as ``stabilizers``; only meaningful with ``stabilizers`` and not
            ``measured_qubits``.
